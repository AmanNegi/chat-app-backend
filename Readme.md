# Chat App Backend🔗 
`Date: 27/11/22` `Node.js`
This repository contains the code for the chat application. The application is simplistic where we simply join a room and chat, the records are maintained in  `MongoDB`.  

### Tech Stack 👩‍💻

1. Node.js (Express, Socket.io, Nodemon)
2. Express
3. jQuery
4. HTML
5. Bootstrap
6. MongoDB

This app is self efficient with it's frontend using `HTML/CSS` however I have developed a React frontend that can consume this app.

> Note: The HTML code uses obselete API's which do not exist it is recommended to use the React App.
